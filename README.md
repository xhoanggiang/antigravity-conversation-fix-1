# Antigravity Conversation Fix

Your Antigravity conversation history disappeared? Conversations showing in the wrong order? Titles replaced with placeholder text? Workspace assignments lost? This tool fixes all of that.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows)

1. Download **`Antigravity_Conversation_Fix.exe`** from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Double-click it — a terminal window will open
3. If Antigravity is still running, the tool will warn you and ask you to close it first
4. The tool scans your conversations, rebuilds the index, and shows you the results
5. Restart your PC, then open Antigravity — your conversations are back, sorted by date

> **No Python or developer tools required.** Just download, run, done.

## What It Fixes

| Problem | Fixed? |
|---|---|
| Conversations missing from sidebar | ✅ |
| Conversations in wrong order | ✅ Sorted newest first |
| Placeholder titles instead of real names | ✅ Restores from brain artifacts |
| Titles lost after previous fix attempts | ✅ Preserves existing titles |
| Workspace assignments stripped on rebuild | ✅ Preserves workspace metadata *(v1.01+)* |
| Conversations not mapped to any workspace | ✅ Interactive workspace assignment *(v1.03+)* |
| Conversations without dates pushed to bottom | ✅ Automatic timestamp injection *(v1.03+)* |

## How It Works

Antigravity stores conversation data in two places:

- **Conversation files** (`*.pb`) — stored in your user profile
- **Sidebar index** — a SQLite database in your app data folder

| OS | Conversations | Database |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\antigravity\conversations\` | `%APPDATA%\antigravity\...\state.vscdb` |
| macOS | `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/` | `~/Library/Application Support/antigravity/.../state.vscdb` |
| Linux | `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/` | `~/.config/Antigravity/.../state.vscdb` |

When the index gets corrupted, conversations still exist on disk but don't show up in the sidebar. This tool scans your conversation files, sorts them by date, pulls titles from brain artifacts, and writes a clean index back to the database.

**Title resolution priority:**
1. Brain artifact `.md` headings (best source)
2. Titles already in the database (preserved across re-runs)
3. Fallback: `Conversation (date) short-id`

## Output Legend

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[+]` | Title extracted from brain artifact |
| `[~]` | Title preserved from existing database |
| `[?]` | Fallback title (no source available) |
| `[WS]` | Workspace metadata preserved *(v1.01+)* |

## Changelog

### v1.03
- **New:** Interactive workspace assignment — conversations without a workspace mapping are listed, and the user can paste a folder path for each one. Supports batch assignment (`all`), skip (`Enter`), and stop (`q`). Invalid paths are rejected with retry.
- **New:** Automatic timestamp injection — conversations missing timestamp metadata now get timestamps derived from the `.pb` file modification time, so they sort correctly in the sidebar instead of being pushed to the bottom.
- **New:** Smarter workspace detection — uses `extract_workspace_hint()` to accurately detect existing workspace URIs in protobuf blobs, replacing the previous heuristic based on blob size.

### v1.02
- **New:** Cross-platform support — the Python script now works on **macOS** and **Linux** in addition to Windows. The `.exe` remains Windows-only.

### v1.01
- **Fix:** Workspace assignments are now preserved when rebuilding the index. Previously, running the tool would strip conversations from their assigned workspace.
- **Note:** If you ran v1.0 and lost workspace assignments, those must be manually re-assigned inside Antigravity. v1.01 prevents this from happening on future runs.

### v1.0
- Initial release — restores missing conversations, sorts by date, fixes titles.

## Advanced: Run from Source (Mac / Linux / Windows)

If you prefer running the Python script directly, or if you are on **Mac** or **Linux** (which cannot run `.exe` files):

```bash
python rebuild_conversations.py
```

Requires Python 3.7+ with no external packages. The script automatically detects your operating system and finds the correct `antigravity` folders.

## Safety

- **Automatic backup** — your current index is saved to `trajectorySummaries_backup.txt` before any changes
- **Non-destructive** — conversation files (`*.pb`) are never modified, only the sidebar index is rebuilt
- **Metadata-preserving** — workspace assignments, timestamps, and other internal state are retained *(v1.01+)*
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times

## FAQ

**Q: Do I really need to restart my PC?**
A: A full restart is the safest way to ensure Antigravity picks up the changes. In most cases, simply closing and reopening Antigravity works too.

**Q: Why do some titles show as "Conversation (Mar 10) abc12345"?**
A: Those conversations don't have brain artifacts, and their original titles weren't in the database. Future re-runs will preserve any titles the app generates going forward.

**Q: Can I run this while Antigravity is open?**
A: The tool will detect if Antigravity is running and warn you. It's recommended to close it first so the app doesn't overwrite your fix when it exits.

**Q: I ran v1.0 and my workspace chats were removed. Will v1.01 bring them back?**
A: Unfortunately no. v1.0 permanently replaced the workspace metadata with title-only data. You'll need to manually drag those conversations back into their workspace inside Antigravity. v1.01 ensures this won't happen again.
